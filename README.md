# PokéDex Project

Hi everyone!, I am Bryan, a passionate software developer here in Costa Rica that really loves technology.

The propose of this project is for showing my abilities as **Front-End** developer using **React** as a framework to create nice appealing web applications.

I decided to create this **PokéDex** application because the **PokéApi** is well structured, have a lot of structured data with different kind of information that can be obtain via **RESTful APIs End-points**. So, it just need to implement a good looking web interface to show the data to the user.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability as a front-end developer to develop various types of web applications using **React**. I aim to manipulate data and present it in an attractive way, showcasing my skills in data management and visualization.

## Where did I get the information?

As I said before I am using the **PokéAPI** https://pokeapi.co/about  to show all the information related with the **Pokémon**. The page will show the Name, an image, stats and other things related with it.

## What you will find on the project?

You will find a page that displays all Pokémon on the screen, including a summary of their stats, image, and name. The Pokémon will be shown in a grid format, allowing you to select a Pokémon and view detailed information about it on a separate page.

## What technologies I use to create to create this project?

To create this project, I used the React framework to develop the application. For page navigation, I employed React-Router-DOM, and I also used the Font Awesome icon library. As my development framework, I utilized Vite to create and generate the production of the page.

## What do I learn from this project?

What I actually learned from this project was how to use React as a tool to create interesting application. I gained an understanding of how to use React's various hooks, such as state, ref, and context, to manage data across different pages and contexts. Additionally, I learned how to make multiple requests to a server and manipulate the returned data to display it on the screen in the desired format. I also reinforce my knowledge related with css, because I design this application keeping in mind that this application will be responsive for any kind of device.
